# Make instructions

Compile all: make all / make

Compile main: make main

Remove all files: make clean

# Run instructions
NOTE: Sample rate by default is 8000. To change this you need to edit the int value labeled SAMPLE_RATE in TestMain.cpp
To run type make, then ./main, then it will prompt you for input,
the input can be entered one at a time or on one line.
The input should be entered in this format:
<Wave Type> <Delay> <Attenuation> <Atime> <Alevel> <Dtime> <Slevel> <Rtime> <Filename>
Where wave type is a value 1-4, delay and attenuation are both floats, all times should sum to less than 1 by default
and Alevel must be greater than Slevel, filename is whatever you'd like!
This input is followed by another prompt to enter notes, enter the notes as int values
that correspond to the keys on a piano [1,88] terminated by a -1 to signal the end of the input.

#To play a sound
NOTE: WaveConverter-2 is not my work and was provided by my professor for the assignment
Once you have run the ./main command you will have generated a .txt file that can be used with
the ./WaveConverter-2 command to generate a .wav, default sample rate is 8000.

#Sample values
I've pre-generated a sample C scale with very dramatized sounds that have wildly fluctuating
volume levels for ease of hearing, you can see the numbers generated by the program in sample_output.txt
and listen to the actual scale generated by playing samples_output.wav
